# T20 World Cup Cricket Data Analytics Project

## Overview

This end-to-end data analytics project involves the use of web scraping, Python, Pandas, and Power BI to analyze T20 World Cup cricket data. The goal is to derive insights and build a dashboard that helps in selecting the best 11 players to form the best team.

## Problem Statement

Using T20 World Cup 2022 data, we aim to build insights and assemble the best 11 players team. This involves:
1. Collecting data from the ESPN Cricinfo website using web scraping.
2. Cleaning and transforming the data using Python and Pandas.
3. Performing further data transformation using Power Query.
4. Building a data model and creating parameters using DAX in Power BI.
5. Developing a dashboard in Power BI to visualize the insights.
6. Selecting the final 11 players based on the insights derived from the dashboard.

## Requirement Scoping

To ensure the project covers all necessary aspects, the following requirements are scoped:
- Web scraping setup using Bright Data to extract data from ESPN Cricinfo.
- Data cleaning and transformation using Python and Pandas.
- Data modeling and parameter creation using DAX in Power BI.
- Dashboard creation in Power BI for visualizing insights.
- Final selection of 11 players based on dashboard insights.

## Data Modeling and Building Parameters using DAX

### Tools Used
- Power BI
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)

### Steps
1. Create relationships between different data tables in Power BI.
2. Use DAX to create calculated columns and measures.
3. Build parameters to enhance the analysis.

## Building the Dashboard in Power BI

### Tools Used
- Power BI

### Steps
1. Design the layout of the dashboard.
2. Add visualizations (charts, tables, etc.) to represent key insights.
3. Ensure the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly.

## Collecting Insights and Selecting the Final 11 Players

### Steps
1. Analyze the dashboard to derive key insights.
2. Based on the insights, select the best 11 players.
3. Justify the selection with data-backed reasoning.
